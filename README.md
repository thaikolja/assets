# What are you doing here?!

Well, well, well, look at you! Looks like your curiosity brought you to a repository you've absolutely no business being in. Shame on you!

No, seriously. This repository is an **asset repository**, which means that it is being used by me, @thaikolja, to avoid paying AWS or other corporations money to store assets that must stay online, for example images or screenshots in `README.md` files.

Most files stored on here will be either image or video files that are public anyway, just in case you were about to waste your time finding out anything valuable.

## thaikolja/gitup

My favorite Markdown editor, **[Typora](https://typora.io/)**, has this great feature that it uploads any image and video files that I drag and drop into the editor. It gives me a few, slightly sketchy looking Chinese providers, but also the option to run a command to do this and return the URL.

That's why I wrote gitup. If you're interested in this project, which I presume is heavily personalized and not meant for the masses but only for myself, go and check out the repository at [thaikolja/gitup](https://github.com/thaikolja/gitup).

It's a very easy Python script that creates a CLI tool which can be run this way:

```bash
python gitup.py <local path> [remove path] [--token]
```

`[remote path]` is redundant if the file should keep its file name. `--token` requires a GitHub Access Token if it's not set in your `~/.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, or similar.

Check out the repository for more details. You don't belong here anyway!
